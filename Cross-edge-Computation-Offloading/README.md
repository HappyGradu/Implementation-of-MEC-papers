A python package of Cross-edge Computation Offloading (CCO) algorithm and its distributed version, Decor for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). 

This package is an implementation of the proposed offloading algorithm for mobility-aware computation-intensive partitionable applications. 
Specifically, for a non-convex edge site-selection sub-problem, we propose a Sampling-and-Classification-based (SAC) algorithm to obtain the 
near optimal solution. Based on Lyapunov optimization CCO algorithm is proposed to jointly determine edge site-selection and energy harvesting 
without a priori knowledge. The transmission, execution and coordination cost, as well as the penalty for task failure, are chosen as performace 
metrics.
